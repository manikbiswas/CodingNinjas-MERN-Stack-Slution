    /*
	
	Pre-requisite to solve this problem:
	In this question, we have to find sum of all even numbers till n. To take sum of all the even numbers, we have to take a variable and initialize it to zero. Let us name this variable as sum. 
	Following code is used to add 2 to sum variable and update it to the same sum variable:
	sum = sum + 2 
	
	Hint to solve this problem: We will have to loop on even numbers only and add the even numbers to the same sum variable, described above.
